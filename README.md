# YRPyWGASuite

This python package contains some wrappers for **pairwise whole genome alignment** pipeline.

It is built based on these two references:

- http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Whole_genome_alignment_howto;

- https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz159 (A genome alignment of 120 mammals highlights ultraconserved element variability and placenta-associated enhancers).
